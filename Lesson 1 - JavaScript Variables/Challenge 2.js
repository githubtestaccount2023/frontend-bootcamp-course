// There are three things wrong with this code. Find them and explain why they are wrong

const some Number = 20;
someNumber = 50

// 1) The variable is invalid. It should be `someNumber`, not `some Number`. There is an extra space
// 2) We should be using let here because later in the code, we re-assign the value of the variable
// 3) This line is missing a semi-colon at the end
